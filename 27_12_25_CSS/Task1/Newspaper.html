            INDIA STEPS UP ACTION ON COUGH SYRUP SAFETY AFTER GLOBAL ALERTS
          </h2>
          <p>
            Indian health authorities have intensified inspections and quality
            checks on cough syrups following international concerns over
            contaminated medicines linked to serious health risks. Regulatory
            bodies have ordered stricter compliance with manufacturing standards
            and increased testing of pharmaceutical exports to ensure patient
            safety. The move comes after reports from multiple countries raised
            alarms about the presence of toxic substances in certain syrup
            formulations. Officials have clarified that only specific batches
            were affected, and action has been taken against manufacturers found
            violating quality norms. Health experts have advised consumers to
            use medicines only as prescribed by registered doctors and to avoid
            self-medication, especially in the case of children. Authorities
            have also assured the public that India’s drug regulatory system is
            being strengthened to prevent similar incidents in the future.

          <h3>GOVERNMENT ORDERS NATIONWIDE AUDIT OF PHARMA UNITS</h3>
          <p>
            In response to growing concerns, the central government has
            announced a nationwide audit of pharmaceutical manufacturing units
            producing liquid oral medicines, including cough syrups. The audit
            aims to identify gaps in quality assurance, raw material sourcing,
            and storage practices. 
            Officials stated that corrective measures
            will be enforced strictly, and non-compliant units may face permanent shutdowns. Industry bodies have welcomed the move, stating
            that maintaining global trust in Indian pharmaceuticals is critical
            for public health and export credibility.
